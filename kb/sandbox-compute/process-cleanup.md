# Clean up the full task process tree and stale workspaces safely

## What

Clean up the full task process tree and stale workspaces safely

Work through a real task, identify phases and feedback, then encode the successful procedure as a versioned reusable asset.

## How to apply (generic)

Test the smallest supported intervention on representative tasks. Compare against a baseline, check correctness and failure cases, and retain a rollback before wider use.

## Expected effect

- **Cost:** Reduce avoidable idle and duplicated compute
- **Speed:** Reduce measured execution/queue bottlenecks
- **Quality:** Reproducible command and environment evidence
- **Reliability:** Isolation, cleanup and recovery guarantees
- **Certainty:** Expected directions, not measured local gains; savings across clusters overlap and must not be added.
